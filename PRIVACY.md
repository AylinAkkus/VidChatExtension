# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Overview

VidChat is a browser extension that lets you chat with YouTube videos using AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**VidChat does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.** We do not have servers.

### What is stored locally

The following data is stored **locally in your browser** using Chrome's storage API:

- **API keys**: Your OpenAI, Google AI, or Anthropic API keys (entered by you in Settings)
- **Chat history**: Your conversations with videos (stored locally for your convenience)
- **Preferences**: Your selected AI model and settings

This data never leaves your browser except when making direct API calls to your chosen AI provider.

### What is sent to third parties

When you ask a question about a video, VidChat sends:

- The video transcript (extracted from YouTube)
- Your question
- Your conversation history for context

This data is sent **directly from your browser** to the AI provider you selected (OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic) using your own API key. We do not proxy, log, or have access to these requests.
